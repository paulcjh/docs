# Overview

The ACB v2.0 is a 3-phase BLDC motor driver with a hall effect positional encoder. it features:

* STM32G474RET6 Controller
* 9v-48v operational voltage range
* USB-C firmware updates and control
* CAN Bus operating at 1MBit/s
* Up to 40A current draw

## Connectors

* XT60 for power supply
* USB-C for firmware updates and control
* 2-Pin JST GH connector for CAN connectivity
* Test points for debugging support with companion board

# Operational range limits

| Name               | Min | Max | Unit |
| :----------------- | :-- | :-- | :--- |
| XT60 Input Voltage | 12   | 50  | V    |
| XT60 Current Draw  | -   | 40  | A    |
| CAN Bus Voltage    | -14 | +14 | V    |

# Programming

There are two methods for programming the ACB:
    1. With the debugger unit (releasing soon)
    2. Using the USB-C connector

To program with the USB-C connector you need to hold down the button on the ACB while powering it up. This will put the STM32 into DFU mode where you can program it directly with the Arduino IDE (or other software of your choice).


# FAQ

### Can I power the board over USB-C?

No. This will be available in future board revisions.
