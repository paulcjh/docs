# Programming

There are two methods for programming the ACB:
    1. With the debugger unit (releasing soon)
    2. Using the USB-C connector

To program with the USB-C connector you need to hold down the button on the ACB while powering it up. This will put the STM32 into DFU mode where you can program it directly with the Arduino IDE (or other software of your choice).
