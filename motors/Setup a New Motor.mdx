# Overview

Setting up a new motor is quite straight forward. Initially you'll need to solder on the 3 motor phases, power up the board, and then proceede to configuring the ACB v2.0.

On this new motor the ACB needs a few pieces of information to operate:
- The numeber of Pole Pairs (half the number of poles).
- The relative orientation of the encoder magnet. This is also known as the zero electrical angle. (if using closed loop control).
- PID parameters for controlling the velocity, position, and torque.

There's a wizard available in the OpenActuator GUI. Navigate to "Tools/Setup New actuator" in the menubar. You'll be propted to enter in the Pole Pairs, and then you may proceede with the calibration.

_Auto calibration for the PID variables is being worked on, check back for updates!_
